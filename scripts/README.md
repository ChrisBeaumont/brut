# Brut Scripts

The scripts in this directory build the final models used in the Brut paper. Some important files here

* `build_full_classifier.py` builds the random forest model. The training data used in this script was generated by '../notebooks/Final Training Data.ipynb`
* `trigger.py` reproduces the triggered star formation analysis from [Kendrew et al. 2012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5486)
